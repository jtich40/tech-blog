## Description
A CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The site follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation

Start in the root directory and run `npm i` in the terminal to install required dependencies. Next, run `mysql -u root -p` to login to MySQL shell. Create the schema by running `source ./db/schema.sql` and then run `quit` to exit MySQL shell. Seed the database by running `npm run seed` in the terminal. Lastly, run `npm start` in the terminal to start the server.

## Usage
The site's homepage is designed to feature existing blog posts with nav links for the homepage, dashboard, and login. The user can add a comment to an existing post by clicking View Blog on the specified post. Please note that you must be logged in to leave a comment on a post. If the user clicks Login or Dashboard in a logged-out state, they will be redirected to the login page where they can either login or signup as a new user. Once logged in, the user is redirected to the Dashboard where they can add a post and see any previously created posts. To add a post, simply fill out the blog title and blog content fields and it will be added to the homepage's list of posts. The user can also edit any existing post on their dashboard by clicking the Edit Blog button. The edit blog page will provide the user with the options to update or delete the post. By updating or deleting a post, the content will either be updated on the homepage or deleted from the homepage.
